# Flowtask
## Minimal Procrastination, Maximum Productivity

Many people have tried the **Pomodoro Technique** which includes 25 minutes of work followed by a 5 minute break. But for many people **even this method doesn't
allow maximum productivity**. Therefore, I did some research online and came across a new method of time management: **flowtime**. Instead of counting down,
you count up. Once you see a decrease in productivity, you take a break. To determine the length of this break, you divide the amount of time you
were working for by 5. This method is superior to Pomodoro because it works around YOUR productivity time.

### Why did I make this?

Because I saw many Pomodoro timers online, but nothing to do flowtime.

### Pricing

This app will always be free and open-source. A majority of applications for time management cost a monthly fee. I hate monthly fees, as the tool never really
feels like it's 'yours' and remains a liability for as long as you use it. This tool truly is yours. No ads, free forever. If you don't like this tool as it is,
feel free to branch off of it and change it to your liking. You don't have to pay, but if you want to pay one-time to say thank you, you can [buy me a hot chocolate!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/AustinBoath)
